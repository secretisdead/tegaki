# secret's tegaki

A simple drawing program.

Serve the contents of [the src directory](src) and visit index.html to run.

You can also run [scripts/build.py](scripts/build.py) to package the tegaki and all support files into a single self-contained html file named tegaki-X.Y.Z.html in the build directory, which can be run locally without being served.
